But abse pakka kabhi bhi nahi hone dungi aisa mai Vinu. I am also sorry for not being understanding enough. I know that you are going through a lot right now (healthwise) and even then I was fighting with you. I love you a lot Vinu and I know I have not been showing much from my actions. But I will try everyday till we get old, to improve myself and show or express as much love as possible through my actions. Please Please Please forgive me baby....")
